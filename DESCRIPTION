Description: An implementation of marginal feature ranking for binary classifications in R. It provides two ranking criteria for users to choose from, classical criterion (CC) and Neyman-Pearson criterion (NPC). The CC ranks marginal features based on empirical risk, while the NPC ranks marginal features based on empirical type II error when type I error is controlled under a small value with a high probability.
